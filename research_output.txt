However, Chelsea's recent performance and historical success in European competitions suggest they remain a competitive team. Their last Champions League triumph was in 2021, and while they have faced challenges in recent seasons, their financial strength and squad depth could position them as contenders in the future. The exact probability remains speculative and would depend on various factors including team performance, managerial strategies, and competition from other top clubs.", "sources": ["search(Chelsea Champions League win probability by 2030)", "wikipedia(UEFA Champions League)", "wikipedia(Chelsea F.C.)"], "tools_used": ["search", "wikipedia"]}

1. Mathematical Interpretation: 2 + 3 represents the sum of two numbers, resulting in 5. This is the most basic and widely understood interpretation.
2. Length Extension Interpretation: If an original length of 2 units is extended by 3 units, the final length becomes 5 units.
3. Composite Addition Interpretation: Combining two quantities (2 and 3) results in a total quantity of 5.

Building an AI Chatbot using LangChain involves several steps, including setting up the environment, integrating with OpenAI's models like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4, and using LangChain's framework to manage the conversation flow. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the chatbot's ability to provide context-aware responses by retrieving relevant information from a knowledge base. The process typically involves creating a Python script, defining the chatbot's logic, and deploying the chatbot for various use cases such as customer service or knowledge management.
